/**
 * Called when the socket has received the requested datagram.
 *
 * Due to the nature of UDP, you may occasionally receive undesired packets.
 * These may be rogue UDP packets from unknown hosts,
 * or they may be delayed packets arriving after retransmissions have already occurred.
 * It's important these packets are properly ignored, while not interfering with the flow of your implementation.
 * As an aid, this delegate method has a boolean return value.
 * If you ever need to ignore a received packet, simply return NO,
 * and AsyncUdpSocket will continue as if the packet never arrived.
 * That is, the original receive request will still be queued, and will still timeout as usual if a timeout was set.
 * For example, say you requested to receive data, and you set a timeout of 500 milliseconds, using a tag of 15.
 * If rogue data arrives after 250 milliseconds, this delegate method would be invoked, and you could simply return NO.
 * If the expected data then arrives within the next 250 milliseconds,
 * this delegate method will be invoked, with a tag of 15, just as if the rogue data never appeared.
 *
 * Under normal circumstances, you simply return YES from this method.
